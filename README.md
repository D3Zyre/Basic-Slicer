# Basic-Slicer

Hello,
 
This is a project I started in summer 2022. I got into 3D printing and wanted to start a code project using the knowledge I gained in first year engineering, so I thought it would be cool to make a slicer.
It converts STLs into gcode, basically.

It should work on any version of Python 3 as far as I'm aware, but if it doesn't work, then try it on Python3 version 3.10.

The script uses numpy, math, and stl, so if you don't have those, you will need to install them with pip/pip3. (I'm pretty sure math comes with Python by default)
